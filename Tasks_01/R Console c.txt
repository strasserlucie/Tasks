| In this lesson, we'll review basic ideas of probability, the study of
| quantifying the likelihood of particular events occurring. Note the
| similarity between the words probability and probably. Every time you use
| the latter word you're implying that an event is more likely than not to
| occur.

  |=====                                                                |   7%
| The first step in understanding probability is to see if you understand what
| outcomes of an experiment are possible. For instance, if you were rolling a
| single, fair die once, how many outcomes are possible?

| The probability of a particular outcome of an experiment is the ratio of the
| number of ways that outcome can occur to all possible outcomes of the
| experiment. Since there are 6 possible outcomes to the experiment of rolling
| a die, and we assume the die is fair, each outcome is equally likely. So
| what is the probability of rolling a 2?

1: 2/6
2: 1/6
3: 1/3

Selection: 2

| You got it!
  |==========                                                           |  14%
| What is the probability of rolling an even number?

  |============                                                         |  17%
| Since the probability of a particular outcome or event E is the ratio of
| ways that E could occur to the number of all possible outcomes or events,
| the probability of E, denoted P(E), is always between 0 and 1. Impossible
| events have a probability of 0 (since they can't occur) and events that are
| certain to occur have a probability of 1.

...5
  |==============                                                       |  21%
| If you're doing an experiment with n possible outcomes, say e1, e2, ..., en,
| then the sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes is 1. If all the
| outcomes are equally likely, as in the case of a fair die, then the
| probability of each is 1/n.

...6
  |=================                                                    |  24%
| If A and B are two independent events then the probability of them both
| occurring is the product of the probabilities. P(A&B) = P(A) * P(B)

  |===================                                                  |  28%
| Suppose you rolled the fair die twice in succession. What is the probability
| of rolling two 4's?

1: 1/36
2: 2/6
3: 1/6
4: 0

Selection: 2

| Not quite, but you're learning! Try again.

| The probability of rolling the first 4 is 1/6. The second roll of the dice
| doesn't depend on the outcome of the first, so that also has a probability
| of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1/6 * 1/6. This makes
| intuitive sense since the probability of 2 such events occurring has to be
| smaller than the probability of only 1 event.

1: 1/6
2: 0

| Suppose you rolled the fair die twice. What is the probability of rolling

Selection: 2

| You almost had it, but not quite. Try again.

| Since we don't care what the outcome of the first roll is, its probability
| is 1. The second roll of the dice has to match the outcome of the first, so
| that has a probability of 1/6. The probability of both events occurring is 1
| * 1/6.

| Now consider the experiment of rolling 2 dice, one red and one green. Assume

  |==========================                                           |  38%
| If an event E can occur in more than one way and these ways are disjoint
| (mutually exclusive) then P(E) is the sum of the probabilities of each of
| the ways in which it can occur.

  |=============================                                        |  41%

| Not quite right, but keep trying.

| Since the highest possible dice roll is a '6', the only combinations which

  |=================================                                    |  48%
| The probability of at least one of two events, A and B, occurring is the sum
| of their individual probabilities minus the probability of their
| intersection. P(A U B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A&B).

...8
  |====================================                                 |  52%
| It's easy to see why this is. Calculating P(A) and P(B) counts outcomes that
| are in both A and B twice, so they're overcounted. The probability of the
| intersection of the two events, denoted as A&B, must be subtracted from the
| sum.

What shall I call you? Lucie Strasser

| Thanks, Lucie Strasser. Let's cover a couple of quick housekeeping items
| before we begin our first lesson. First of all, you should know that when
| you see '...', that means you should press Enter when you are done reading
| and ready to continue.

...  <-- That's your cue to press Enter to continue

| Also, when you see 'ANSWER:', the R prompt (>), or when you are asked to
| select from a list, that means it's your turn to enter a response, then
| press Enter to continue.

Select 1, 2, or 3 and press Enter 

1: Continue.
2: Proceed.
3: Let's get going!

Selection: 
Enter an item from the menu, or 0 to exit
Selection: 0

| You can exit swirl and return to the R prompt (>) at any time by pressing
| the Esc key. If you are already at the prompt, type bye() to exit and save
| your progress. When you exit properly, you'll see a short message letting
| you know you've done so.

| When you are at the R prompt (>):
| -- Typing skip() allows you to skip the current question.
| -- Typing play() lets you experiment with R on your own; swirl will ignore
| what you do...
| -- UNTIL you type nxt() which will regain swirl's attention.
| -- Typing bye() causes swirl to exit. Your progress will be saved.
| -- Typing main() returns you to swirl's main menu.
| -- Typing info() displays these options again.

| Let's get started!

| To begin, you must install a course. I can install a course for you from the
| internet, or I can send you to a web page
| (https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses) which will provide course
| options and directions for installing courses yourself. (If you are not
| connected to the internet, type 0 to exit.)

1: R Programming: The basics of programming in R
2: Regression Models: The basics of regression modeling in R
3: Statistical Inference: The basics of statistical inference in R
4: Exploratory Data Analysis: The basics of exploring data in R
5: Don't install anything for me. I'll do it myself.
